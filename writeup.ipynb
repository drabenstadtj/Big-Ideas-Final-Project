    "## Plan\n",
    "Our plan is to use the Neighborhoods dataset and a python script that verifies if a point's latitude and longitude fall inside of a given neighborhood. We will do this for every neighborhood. Using the count of each submetric (Parks, Protected Lanes, and Transit Stops) we will determine a score for each neighborhood and choose that neighborhood as our 'best' neighborhood. Using the counts for each metric for each neighborhood, we will normalize the counts into values which we will then we will composite into an overall score of 'bestness'.\n"
