    "## Why\n",
    "\n",
    "When deciding which metrics to pick, we thought it made sense to determine factors that affect our daily lives. Being students who live off campus, we spend time nearly everyday commuting to and from campus relying on buses and bike lanes. Additionally, we both enjoy spending time in parks around the city. Therefore, our chosen metrics—number of bus stops, length of bike lanes, and amount of parks—reflect our personal experiences and preferences, aiming to quantify the elements that enhance our daily lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Public Transit Accessibility (Number of Bus Stops):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Public transit accessibility is a vital factor for many residents when choosing a neighborhood.\n",
    "- Number of bus stops indicates the extent of public transit coverage within the neighborhood.\n",
    "- More bus stops imply better access to transportation, which enhances mobility and reduces reliance on private vehicles.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Active Transportation Infrastructure (Length of Bike Lanes):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Length of bike lanes reflects the neighborhood's commitment to promoting active transportation.\n",
    "- Bike lanes encourage cycling, which promotes physical activity, reduces traffic congestion, and decreases carbon emissions.\n",
    "- Well-connected bike lanes enhance connectivity within the neighborhood and to neighboring areas, contributing to overall livability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quality of Outdoor Spaces (Amount of Parks):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parks and green spaces are essential for recreation, relaxation, and community engagement.\n",
    "- The amount of parks within a neighborhood indicates its dedication to providing accessible outdoor amenities for residents.\n",
    "- Parks offer numerous health and social benefits, including stress reduction, improved mental well-being, and opportunities for social interaction."

    "## Plan\n",
    "Our plan is to use a dataset we found that contains data detailing the location and bounds of each neighborhood and a python script that verifies if a point's latitude and longitude fall inside of a given neighborhood. We will do this for every neighborhood. Using the count of each submetric (Parks, Protected Lanes, and Transit Stops) we will determine a score for each neighborhood and choose that neighborhood as our 'best' neighborhood. Using the counts for each metric for each neighborhood, we will normalize the counts into values which we will then we will composite into an overall score of 'bestness'.\n",

    "To determine if a point falls within a neighborhood, we first create a list of shapely polygons containing location data for each neighborhood. We keep track of the names of each neighborhood by creating another list of names. Once we have a list of polygons we have a function that accepts a coordinate in the form of latitude and longitude. The function iterates through each neighborhood and uses shapely.polygon.contains() to determine if the point falls within the neighborhood polygon. If the point is within the neighborhood it returns the name of the neighborhood."

    "#### Determining a Metric For Bike Lanes\n",
    "Determining a metric for bike lanes was not as simple. The dataset we chose store bike lanes in geojson as pairs of points marking the beginning and end points of lines that create segments of a larger line, known as a MultiLineString in geojson. One way to use this data is to count how many of the beginning and end points fall within a neighborhood. After some thought we decided this information wouldnt be representative as lines with more curves would have more points thus scoring higher. Instead, we decided to create a metric for the length of bike lanes within a neighborhood. To do this, we created code that iterated through each bike lane feature in the dataset geojson. We then convert the feature into a shapely object and iterate through our neighborhoods checking if the bike lane intersects the neighborhood polygon. If it does intersect, generate the part that intersects as a new line then add its length to the corresponding neighborhoods bike lane length attribute.\n"
