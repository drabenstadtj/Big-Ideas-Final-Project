For each neighborhood I used the shapely.intersects() method to determine if the bike lane intersects (overlaps) the neighborhood. If it did, I used the shapely.intersection() method to get the LineString or MultiLineString object that stores the part of the bike lane that overlaps the neighborhood. The LineString objects has a length property which I then add to the existing length sum."
